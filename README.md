PRObabilistic CLAssification Metrics

_(Or proclamations of a professional clam?  You decide!)_

## Motivation

This is a space for developing the metrics for the Photometric LSST AStronomical TIme Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC).

An immediate goal is to implement the metrics described [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8q0mp2lDo8xbKOs15GS4WLKKNMK_TY7/view?usp=sharing) and demonstrate them on mock classification results, in an effort to identify the vulnerabilities and strengths of the metrics we're considering.

This repository may also serve as a space for experimenting with how to combine metrics to declare a winner for the Kaggle requirement.
