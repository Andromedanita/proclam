PRObabilistic CLAssification Metrics

_(or proclamations of a professional clam?  You decide!)_

## Motivation

This is a space for developing the metrics for the Photometric LSST AStronomical TIme Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC).

An immediate goal is to implement the metrics described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pg0KUY0KihjlWKwoCE7Fc29u9pjv-fhwUnL8o34s58k/edit) and demonstrate them on mock classification results, in an effort to identify the vulnerabilities and strengths of the metrics we're considering.

This repository may also serve as a space for experimenting with how to combine metrics to declare a winner for the Kaggle requirement.
