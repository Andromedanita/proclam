PRObabilistic CLAssification Metrics for PLAsTiCC
(or proclamations of a professional clam?  You decide!)

## Motivation
This is a space for developing the metrics for PLAsTiCC.  An immediate goal is to implement the metrics described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VLDaaO6Zdwv9GnElryU4shRZqcbBymboYKkJ_uixTxU/edit#) and demonstrate them on mock classification results.  The goal is to identify the vulnerabilities and strengths of the possible metrics we're considering and to experiment with how to combine metrics to declare a winner for a Kaggle competition.
