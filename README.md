PRObabilistic CLAssification Metrics for PLAsTiCC

/(or proclamations of a professional clam?  You decide!)/

## Motivation

This is a space for developing the metrics for PLAsTiCC.

An immediate goal is to implement the metrics described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VLDaaO6Zdwv9GnElryU4shRZqcbBymboYKkJ_uixTxU/edit#) and demonstrate them on mock classification results, in an effort to identify the vulnerabilities and strengths of the metrics we're considering.

This repository may also serve as a space for experimenting with how to combine metrics to declare a winner for the Kaggle requirement.
